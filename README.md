Lazy Film Reviews uses a transformer model for summarization from HuggingFace to generate concise summaries of film reviews. It also scores the sentiment of the review using a sci-kit learn LinearSVC model, trained on the classic IMDB dataset. A wordcloud containing the descriptive words used in the review(eg:adjectives) is also displayed. The Streamlit library is used to create the web app.
