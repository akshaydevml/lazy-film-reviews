Lazy Film Reviews is a Streamlit app for summarizing and sentiment scoring movie reviews. Input any film review of choice and click 'Generate' to get a concise summary and an overall sentiment indicating whether the review was positive or negative. We also display a Wordcloud containing descriptive terms in the input and the ROUGE metric to gauge the effectiveness of the summary.

We fine-tuned the `funnel-transformer/small` using Hugging Face to create a [custom model](https://huggingface.co/Sreevishnu/funnel-transformer-small-imdb) for the sentiment analysis task.

For text summarization, we use the pretrained `distilbart-cnn-6-6` (by [sshleifer](https://github.com/sshleifer)) from Hugging Face hub, trained on the CNN/DailyMail dataset.

In the garden of wonderment that is the body of work by the animation master Hayao Miyazaki, his 2001 gem 'Spirited Away' is at once one of his most accessible films to a Western audience and the one most distinctly rooted in Japanese culture and lore. The tale of Chihiro, a 10 year old girl who resents being moved away from all her friends, only to find herself working in a bathhouse for the gods, doesn’t just use its home country’s fraught relationship with deities as a backdrop. Never remotely didactic, the film is ultimately a self-fulfilment drama that touches on religious, ethical, ecological and psychological issues. 

It’s also a fine children’s film, the kind that elicits a deepening bond across repeat viewings and the passage of time, mostly because Miyazaki refuses to talk down to younger viewers. That’s been a constant in all of his filmography, but it’s particularly conspicuous here because the stakes for its young protagonist are bigger than in most of his previous features aimed at younger viewers. It involves conquering fears and finding oneself in situations where safety is not a given.

There are so many moving parts in Spirited Away, from both a thematic and technical point of view, that pinpointing what makes Spirited Away stand out from an already outstanding body of work becomes as challenging as a meeting with Yubaba. But I think it comes down to an ability to deal with heady, complex subject matter from a young girl's perspective without diluting or lessening its resonance. Miyazaki has made a loopy, demanding work of art that asks your inner child to come out and play. There are few high-wire acts in all of movie-dom as satisfying as that.
